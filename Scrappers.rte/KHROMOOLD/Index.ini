	Description = Mostly cheap, weak and useless, the Scrappers are less of a faction and more of a group - a group full of nobodies. Originally founded as a singular faction, but later disbanded into several infighting gangs (the Scrappers being one of them) all utilising the same 4 types of genetic code to create cloned soldiers, their main strength is cheapness - even their (relatively) powerful weaponry is dirt-cheap and easy to produce. Just don't put them up against the Heavies.
